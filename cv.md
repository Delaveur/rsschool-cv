## Brief Self-Introduction

I am a content-manager in Vobus group. I have started my career in 2011 with zero skills in html/css or programming. Since then i have learned a lot, especially how to work in different CMS, CRM, and web-servers and how to work with integrations to the web site. 

But since then i haven't get any essential skills in programming. I hope that studying at RS School will provide me with a strong foundation to start my journey as a programmer. And i will do everything that depends on me.
